/**
 * Abstract base class for all shop object implementations.
 * <p>
 * Make sure to call {@link AbstractShopkeeper#markDirty()} on every change of data that might need
 * to be persisted.
 * <p>
 * The shop object needs to {@link #onIdChanged() register} itself whenever it is spawned,
 * despawned, or its object id might have changed. If this type of shop object manages its
 * {@link AbstractShopObjectType#mustBeSpawned() spawning} itself, it might need to register itself
 * earlier than shop objects whose spawning is managed by the Shopkeepers plugin: For instance, if
 * the shop object is already spawned during or shortly after chunk loads, it needs to be registered
 * in this exact moment, rather than when the shopkeeper's chunk is activated. And if the shop
 * object is able to spawn before the shopkeeper has been created or loaded, it may need to register
 * itself during {@link #onShopkeeperAdded(ShopkeeperAddedEvent.Cause)}.
 * <p>
 * If this type of shop object is able to move, teleport, or be spawned into a different chunk, the
 * {@link ShopkeeperRegistry} needs to be made aware of these location changes by
 * {@link AbstractShopkeeper#setLocation(Location) updating the location} of the corresponding
 * shopkeeper. If the shopkeeper is not ticking currently (i.e. if its previous chunk is not active
 * currently), these location updates need to happen quickly, so that the chunk of the shopkeeper's
 * new location, if currently loaded, can be activated and start the shopkeeper's ticking as quickly
 * as possible.
